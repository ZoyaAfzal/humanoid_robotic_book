# Context7 Documentation Retrieval

## Instructions

### When to Activate
1. User requests code generation using external libraries
2. User asks about API usage, methods, or library features
3. User mentions specific frameworks (Next.js, FastAPI, Better Auth, SQLModel, etc.)
4. User needs setup instructions or configuration examples
5. User adds "use context7" to their prompt

### How to Approach
1. **Identify the library**: Extract library name from user query
2. **Resolve library ID**: Use `resolve-library-id` tool with library name to find exact ID (format: `/owner/repo`)
3. **Retrieve documentation**: Use `get-library-docs` tool with the resolved ID and relevant topics
4. **Generate response**: Use retrieved docs to provide accurate, current code examples

### Specific Workflows

**Workflow 1: Basic Code Generation**
```
User: "Create Next.js middleware for JWT auth"
→ resolve-library-id("next.js")
→ get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", topics: ["middleware", "authentication"])
→ Generate code using retrieved docs
```

**Workflow 2: Version-Specific Query**
```
User: "Show React 18 hooks usage"
→ resolve-library-id("react 18")
→ get-library-docs("/facebook/react/v18.0.0", topics: ["hooks"])
→ Provide version-specific examples
```

**Workflow 3: Multiple Libraries**
```
User: "Set up Supabase auth with Next.js"
→ resolve-library-id("supabase")
→ resolve-library-id("next.js")
→ get-library-docs for both libraries
→ Combine documentation for integrated solution
```

### Tool Parameters

**resolve-library-id**
- Input: Library name (string)
- Returns: Array of matching libraries with IDs, descriptions, versions
- Use: Always call first to get exact library ID

**get-library-docs**
- libraryId: Exact ID from resolve-library-id (e.g., "/vercel/next.js")
- topics: Array of relevant keywords (e.g., ["routing", "api"])
- mode: "code" for examples, "info" for guides (default: "code")
- limit: Number of snippets (1-100, default: 10)
- version: Specific version if needed

### Output Format
1. Acknowledge library being used
2. Provide code examples from documentation
3. Include explanations based on retrieved docs
4. Cite source pages when relevant
5. Mention if using specific version

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Always resolve library ID before fetching docs
- Use specific topics to get relevant documentation
- Specify versions when user mentions them (e.g., "Next.js 16", "Python 3.11")
- Cache library IDs for repeated queries in same session
- Combine multiple library docs for integration tasks
- Cite documentation sources in responses
- Prioritize official documentation over third-party sources
- Check for latest API changes when dealing with rapidly evolving libraries

### Don'ts
- Don't guess library IDs - always use resolve-library-id
- Don't use outdated APIs - always fetch fresh docs
- Don't skip documentation retrieval for known libraries
- Don't ignore version specifications from user
- Don't provide generic answers when docs are available
- Don't mix incompatible versions (e.g., Next.js 16 patterns with middleware.ts)

### Phase 2 Specific Best Practices
- For Next.js 16+: Use proxy.ts instead of middleware.ts
- For Better Auth: Always mention JWT plugin for backend integration
- For SQLModel: Include pool_recycle for serverless databases like Neon
- For FastAPI: Demonstrate async/await patterns by default
- For monorepo: Show both frontend and backend code when relevant

### Error Handling
- If library not found: Suggest similar libraries or ask for clarification
- If no docs available: Inform user and offer alternatives
- If rate limited: Inform user to add API key for higher limits
- If ambiguous library name: Present options from resolve-library-id results
- If version mismatch: Warn user about potential compatibility issues

### Constraints
- Rate limit: 60 requests/hour (free), higher with API key
- Max 100 snippets per request
- Documentation reflects latest indexed version unless specified
- Private repos require Pro plan and authentication

### Performance Tips
- Use specific library IDs (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`) to skip resolution
- Filter by topics to reduce irrelevant results
- Request appropriate limit (5-10 for quick answers, more for comprehensive docs)
- Leverage pagination for extensive documentation needs
- Batch related queries when building full-stack examples
