# ADR 004: Context 7 Feedback Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Physical AI textbook requires a mechanism to collect feedback from readers on the content quality, difficulty level, and overall learning experience. This feedback is critical for continuous improvement of the educational material. Context 7 specifically refers to the implementation of a feedback collection system that is seamlessly integrated into the textbook modules.

## Decision
We will implement a custom React component that embeds a Google Form to collect feedback from readers. This component will be placed at the end of each module summary page to capture immediate impressions while the content is fresh in the reader's mind.

The component will include:
- A visually distinct section with clear labeling as "Context 7: Textbook Feedback"
- An embedded Google Form with questions about content clarity, difficulty, and suggestions
- Guidance for users on what aspects to provide feedback on
- Responsive design to work across different devices

## Rationale
- Google Forms provides an easy-to-use, accessible platform for collecting structured feedback
- React components allow for seamless integration into the Docusaurus-based textbook
- Placing the form at the end of each module ensures feedback is module-specific
- Custom styling maintains visual consistency with the textbook while making the feedback section distinct

## Implementation Details
- The component is implemented as `Context7.js` in the `src/components` directory
- It uses CSS modules for styling to avoid conflicts with other components
- The Google Form is embedded using an iframe for security and compatibility
- The component is imported and used in MDX files with the syntax `<Context7 />`

## Consequences
### Positive
- Readers can easily provide feedback without leaving the textbook
- Structured feedback allows for systematic improvements
- The component can be reused across multiple modules
- Integration with Google Forms enables easy analysis of feedback data

### Negative
- Dependency on Google Forms service availability
- Requires maintenance of the external form
- Additional page load time due to embedded form

### Neutral
- Feedback quality depends on reader engagement
- Requires configuration of Google Form with appropriate questions
