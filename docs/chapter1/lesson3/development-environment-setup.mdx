# Development Environment Setup

In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up a comprehensive development environment for humanoid robotics projects. A properly configured environment is essential for efficient development, testing, and deployment of humanoid robot applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your development environment, ensure you have:

- A computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 50GB+ of available disk space
- A 64-bit operating system (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS, Windows 10/11, or macOS 10.15+)
- Administrative privileges to install software
- Stable internet connection

## Core Software Components

### 1. Robot Operating System (ROS)

ROS is the middleware framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster, including hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

**Installation Steps:**
1. Update your system: `sudo apt update`
2. Install ROS Noetic (for Ubuntu) following the official installation guide
3. Set up your ROS environment by sourcing the setup file
4. Install additional ROS packages relevant to humanoid robotics

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Choose an IDE that supports robotics development:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Lightweight with ROS extensions
- **PyCharm**: Excellent for Python-based robotics development
- **CLion**: Great for C++ development in robotics

### 3. Simulation Environment

- **Gazebo**: 3D dynamic simulator with high-quality physics
- **RViz**: 3D visualization tool for ROS
- **Webots**: Alternative robotics simulator with built-in physics engine

## Version Control Setup

### Git Configuration
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Recommended Repository Structure
```
humanoid_robot_project/
├── src/                 # Source code
├── models/              # Robot models and URDF files
├── launch/              # ROS launch files
├── config/              # Configuration files
├── scripts/             # Utility scripts
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── README.md
```

## Development Tools

### 1. Docker for Isolated Environments
Docker helps create consistent, isolated development environments:
```bash
# Example Dockerfile for ROS development
FROM ros:noetic

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    ros-noetic-ros-base \
    python3-catkin-tools \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set up workspace
WORKDIR /workspace
```

### 2. Virtual Environments
For Python development:
```bash
python3 -m venv humanoid_robot_env
source humanoid_robot_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing Frameworks

### Unit Testing
- **rostest**: ROS testing framework
- **pytest**: Python testing framework
- **Google Test**: C++ testing framework

### Integration Testing
- Develop tests that verify multiple components work together
- Test robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Consistency**: Ensure all team members use the same environment setup
2. **Documentation**: Document your environment setup process
3. **Backup Configurations**: Save your environment configurations as scripts
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep your development tools updated
5. **Isolation**: Use containers or virtual machines to avoid conflicts

## Hands-on Exercise

1. Set up your development environment following the steps outlined above
2. Create a simple ROS workspace
3. Write a basic "Hello World" publisher and subscriber
4. Test your setup by running the nodes in your environment
