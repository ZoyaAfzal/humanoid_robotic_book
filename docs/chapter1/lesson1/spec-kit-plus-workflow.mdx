# Spec-Kit Plus Workflow

In this lesson, you'll learn about the Spec-Kit Plus workflow for humanoid robotics development. This systematic approach helps you plan, design, and implement humanoid robots efficiently.

## Overview

The Spec-Kit Plus workflow consists of several phases:

1. **Specification Phase**: Define requirements and constraints
2. **Design Phase**: Create detailed designs and blueprints
3. **Implementation Phase**: Build and integrate components
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate functionality and performance
5. **Optimization Phase**: Refine and improve the system

## Key Concepts

- **Modular Architecture**: Building blocks that can be combined
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous refinement and improvement
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support for various hardware platforms
- **Scalability**: Systems that can grow with your needs

## Practical Application

Try implementing a basic humanoid robot specification using the following template:

```yaml
robot:
  name: "My Humanoid Robot"
  height: "1.2m"
  weight: "15kg"
  degrees_of_freedom: 24
  sensors:
    - "IMU"
    - "LiDAR"
    - "Cameras"
  actuators:
    - "Servo Motors"
    - "Linear Actuators"
```

## Hands-on Exercise

1. Define the basic specifications for your humanoid robot
2. Identify the key components needed
3. Plan the integration workflow
