# Kinematics and Dynamics of Humanoid Robots

Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of humanoid robots is crucial for their control and movement. This section covers the mathematical foundations that describe how these robots move through space.

## Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In humanoid robotics, we focus on two main types:

### Forward Kinematics
Forward kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector (such as a hand) based on the joint angles. This is essential for determining where the robot's limbs are in space.

### Inverse Kinematics
Inverse kinematics solves the opposite problem: given a desired position and orientation of the end-effector, it calculates the required joint angles. This is critical for motion planning and task execution.

## Dynamics

Dynamics considers the forces and torques that cause motion. For humanoid robots, this includes:

- **Centrifugal and Coriolis forces**: Due to the robot's motion
- **Gravitational forces**: Always acting on the robot's mass
- **External forces**: From interactions with the environment

## Balance and Stability

Maintaining balance is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robotics. Key concepts include:

- **Center of Mass (CoM)**: The average location of the robot's mass
- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: A point where the sum of all moments caused by ground reaction forces equals zero
- **Capture Point**: A location where the robot can step to stop its motion

## Control Strategies

Various control strategies are used to manage the complex dynamics of humanoid robots:

- **PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control for joint position
- **Model Predictive Control**: Advanced control that predicts future states
- **Whole-Body Control**: Simultaneous control of multiple tasks
